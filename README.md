# machine-learning-hw

Homework for my machine learning class. The assignments are:
1. Perform Linear Regression using sklearn and plot it. Implement a k Nearest Neighbors Algorithm and test it on the dataset. Perform cross validation with 5 folds. For this algorithm I was asked to code it up from scratch without sklearn or other libraries.
