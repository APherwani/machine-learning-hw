Homework for my machine learning class. The assignments are:
1. Perform Linear Regression using sklearn and plot it. Implement a k Nearest Neighbors Algorithm and test it on the dataset. Perform cross validation with 5 folds. For this algorithm I was asked to code it up from scratch without sklearn or other libraries. I got the dataset from the UCI ML repository. Here is the link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris
2. Use Scikit learn to do Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine. Use linear and rbf kernel SVC's. Bonus: Use sigmoid. Dataset from UCI ML repo. Link:
